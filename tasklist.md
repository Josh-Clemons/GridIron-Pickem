To complete base mode:
    [x] lock pick fields after the week has started
    [] about page
    [] styling
        [] set theme
    [] edit league name
    [] comment code
    [] update readme

Stretch goals:
    [] update types (remove :any)
    [] private leagues
    [] show scores on weekly pick page
    [] visually show what teams win/lose on weekly pick page


Notes to self:
    - set join league to refresh instead of go to dashboard
    - for MUI theme, look at cssbaseline, also need to wrap App in ThemeProvider (only need once in application, put at very top)


    Problems with calculations:
    - laurie olender




    Notes for mark:
        Inconsistencies with spreadsheet:
            - Mark's Week 1 point 1 has SF and IND on selection history
            - Mark's LAC/LAR for week 2 points 3
            - Julie Daly has LV for 3 points week 7, 10, and 14 on the main page, nothing for for 3 point week 10 or 14 on selection history
