To complete base mode:
    [x] lock pick fields after the week has started
    [x] about page
    [x] rules
    [x] mui modal or sweet alert confirmations
    [x] styling
        [x] set theme
    [x] edit league name
    [x] comment code
    [] update readme

Stretch goals:
    [] update types (remove :any)
    [] private leagues
    [] league manager tools
        [] make a new component, move rename/delete there. 
        [] change other user's picks
    [] error handle if get logged out of server
    [] limit options to teams not already picked
    [] lock fields only after the corresponding game starts (or after the last game of the week starts)
        [] limit options accordingly
    [] show scores on weekly pick page
    [] visually show what teams win/lose on weekly pick page
    [] accessability?
    [] make a big table that shows everyone's complete picks all at once
    [] setup max users


Notes to self:
    - set join league to refresh instead of go to dashboard
        - figure out why on refresh it redirects to login/dashboard. Is this an async problem and Passport doesn't see we are logged in until after navigate takes us to login page?
