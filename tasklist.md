To complete base mode:
    [x] lock pick fields after the week has started
    [] about page
    [] rules
    [] sweet alert confirmations
    [] styling
        [] set theme
    [] edit league name
    [] comment code
    [] update readme

Stretch goals:
    [] update types (remove :any)
    [] private leagues
    [] limit options to teams not already picked
    [] lock fields only after the corresponding game starts (or after the last game of the week starts)
        [] limit options accordingly
    [] show scores on weekly pick page
    [] visually show what teams win/lose on weekly pick page
    [] accessability?
    [] make a big table that shows everyone's complete picks all at once
    [] setup max users


Notes to self:
    - set join league to refresh instead of go to dashboard
        - figure out why on refresh it redirects to login/dashboard. Is this an async problem and Passport doesn't see we are logged in until after navigate takes us to login page?
